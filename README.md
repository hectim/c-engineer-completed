# Gachi Flip Flops

##### A plugin for [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/)
It's basically the same thing as the C Engineer Completed plugin but instead it GachiGasms every time you complete an achievement

### Announcement options include
- level ups
- quests
- collection log slot (requires game chat notification messages)
- achievement diaries (per tier, not per task)
- combat achievements (per task, not per tier)
- dying "on my hcim" (plays for any account type)

you can also type "lvl up" or "death" to test the sounds

### Planned / Work In Progress expansions
- none

### Potential future expansions
- clue scroll completion
- big drop notification (configurable threshold)
- longer gachi sounds that are small enough to fit in the 10mb limit

### Known Issues
- PulseAudio on linux can just refuse to accept the audio formats used despite claiming to accept them :man_shrugging:
